# NLP-Summarization-Project
This project implements an extractive summarization system using BERT to automatically generate concise summaries from long text documents. BERT is used to encode sentence-level representations, capturing deep contextual meaning. Sentences are then ranked based on relevance, and the most important ones are selected to form the summary.
